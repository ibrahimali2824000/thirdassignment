    <h1>Zara, The Clever Zebra
    </h1>
    <p>Zara the zebra was the fastest and most clever of them all. Her black and white stripes made her stand out, and her quick thinking saved the group from trouble many times. Zara had a knack for solving problems, whether it was finding a shortcut through the forest or figuring out how to cross a deep ravine.</p>
    <p>Once, when a heavy rainstorm caused the river to flood, blocking their path, Zara quickly came up with a plan. She led the group to a fallen tree that could be used as a bridge. With her guidance, they crossed safely. Her intelligence and ability to think under pressure made her an invaluable member of the group.</p>
