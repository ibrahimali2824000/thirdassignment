    <h1>Leo, The Brave Leader
    </h1>

    <p>Leo was the bravest of them all. As the lion, he was considered the leader of the group, and he took his role seriously. He had a golden mane that shimmered under the sun, and his roar could be heard for miles. Leo was always watching over his friends, making sure they were safe from any danger lurking in the wild.</p>

       <p> One day, as they were playing near a river, Leo sensed something unusual. His sharp eyes caught sight of a movement in the bushes nearby. With a quick leap, he stood in front of his friends, growling softly. It turned out to be a harmless deer, but his friends admired his courage. They knew that with Leo around, they were always protected.</p>
