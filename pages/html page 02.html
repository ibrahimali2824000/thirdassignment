    <h1>Ellie, The Gentle Giant
    </h1>

    <p>Ellie the elephant was the largest of the group but had the gentlest heart. She loved playing with her friends, using her strong trunk to lift them up and twirl them in the air. Ellie was wise and kind, often helping settle disputes among her friends with her calm and soothing voice.</p>
    <p>One time, while wandering deep in the forest, they came across a tall tree with delicious-looking fruits hanging high above. None of the animals could reach them. Seeing her friends struggling, Ellie stepped forward and used her long trunk to gently pull down the fruits. She shared them with everyone, reminding them of the importance of kindness and sharing.</p>
