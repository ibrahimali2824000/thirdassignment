    <h1>Milo, The Mischievous Monkey
    </h1>
    <p>Milo the monkey was the youngest and the most mischievous. He was always up to some playful antics, swinging from trees and teasing his friends. Though sometimes his tricks got him into trouble, Milo’s cheerful nature always brightened up their day.</p>
    <p>One day, while they were resting near a cliff, Milo couldn’t resist climbing a nearby tree to get a better view. But as he climbed higher, the branch beneath him started to crack. Before he could fall, Leo rushed to the base of the tree, roaring for help. Ellie extended her trunk, and with Zara’s quick directions, they formed a rescue plan. Benji stood ready, and together they pulled Milo to safety. It was a close call, but Milo learned a valuable lesson about teamwork and listening to his friends.</p>
